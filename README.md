# Wes.dev Website

This is the source code for my website since 2014.

The current version uses [Astro](https://astro.build/).

The 1999 version is a parody and was created in modern times.

## Development

This project uses `wes-cli`, which simplifies configuration setup. Instead of
using `yarn install`, you should use `npx wes-cli install`, which will create
all configuration files and run `yarn install`.
